Looks like, Webstorm having trouble when resolving generic types from within single-file vue components. This is small demo to demonstrate it, using types I was using in my project.

After installing dependencies, you can compare `inside-vue.vue` & `outside-vue.ts` files and make note of difference between errors for same components, when these expected to be exactly the same.
